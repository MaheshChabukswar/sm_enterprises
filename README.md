  - Fix bugs and optimize performance.

## Week 5 (Days 29-35): Deployment and Final Touches

- **Days 29-31: Deployment Preparation**
  - Prepare your application for deployment.
  - Choose a hosting service and set up the environment.

- **Days 32-35: Deployment**
  - Deploy your application to the chosen hosting platform.
  - Perform post-deployment testing to ensure everything works correctly.

## Week 6 (Days 36-40): Review and Buffer

- **Days 36-38: Documentation**
  - Create comprehensive documentation for your code and application.

- **Days 39-40: Buffer Days**
  - Use these days to address any unforeseen issues or delays.

## Additional Resources
